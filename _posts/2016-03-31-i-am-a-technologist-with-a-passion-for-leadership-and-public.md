I am a technologist with a passion for leadership and public policy. I have established an elementary to middle school in the sefwi area of the western region  of Ghana. I serve on the board of two non-profits and three organizations.

I host a weekly podcast called LeadOneAfrica Podcast.  The mission of the podcast is about building a body of knowledge on effective leadership for the next generation of african leaders. 

I am married, I have three kids, and love the Lord.
